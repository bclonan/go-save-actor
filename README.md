# My Golang Plugin

This is a reusable Go-lang plugin that resolves actor-based promises, accepts files, and exposes GitHub APIs as curryable commands through the adapter/facade pattern.

## Getting Started

To get started with this plugin, you need to have Go installed on your machine. Once you have Go installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

Import the necessary packages from the project in your Go file. You can use the exported types and functions to interact with the GitHub API, handle promises, and work with actors.

## Packages

The project includes the following packages:

- `actor`: Defines the Actor type and its methods.
- `promises`: Defines the Promise type and its methods.
- `githubapi`: Provides functions to interact with the GitHub API.
- `adapter`: Implements the Adapter pattern to provide a consistent interface for the GitHub API.
- `facade`: Implements the Facade pattern to provide a simplified interface to the complex subsystems.

## Testing

The project includes tests for the main application. Run the tests using the `go test` command.
